The Zerologon exploiter exploits [CVE-2020-1472](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-1472).

This exploiter is unsafe.
* It will temporarily change the target domain controller's password.
* It may break the target domain controller's communication with other systems in the network, affecting functionality.

It is, therefore, **not** enabled by default.


### Description

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC).
